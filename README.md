# MicroX_Emotion_Recognition
While most studies focus on the model and its parameters, our study aims to add an additional depth to the field of emotion recognition, by learning from the best applications of neural networks and processing, us humans. As we try so hard to innovate and derive new models, our study places emphasis instead on the approach, and how we intend to break down the problem. Studies of the human behaviour, body language and micro expressions specialists are those who we can learn from. This forms the motivation for our micro expression (MicroX) model. While the average human understands emotion based on past exposure or experience, subconsciously being able to tell how another person might be feeling through his/her facial expressions, experts on the other hand are able to quantify what they see before them and make accurate judgements.
